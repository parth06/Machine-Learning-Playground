# Diabetes Prediction #

Various available traditional methods for diagnosing diabetes are based on physical and
chemical tests. These methods can have errors due to different uncertainties. A number of
Data mining algorithms were designed to overcome these uncertainties. 

Among these algorithms, amalgam KNN provides higher classification accuracy than the existing approaches.
# List of Algorithms #
## Gaussian Naive Bayes : ##
The assumptions on distributions of features are called the event
model of the Naive Bayes classifier. For discrete features like the ones encountered in
document classification (include spam filtering), multinomial and Bernoulli distributions are
popular.
## KNN: ##
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new
cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical
estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970's as a non-parametric
technique. Algorithm.
## SVM: ##
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a
separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the
algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples
## Decision tree : ##
A decision tree is a graph that uses a branching method to illustrate every
possible outcome of adecision. ... Programmatically, they can be used to assign monetary/time
or other values to possible outcomes so that decisions can be automated.
